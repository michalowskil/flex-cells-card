# Hue & Saturation

**This example works starting with version 0.20.0, which is currently in pre-release. If you want to test this functionality before the official release, you must manually select v0.20.0-beta in HACS.**

The hue and saturation sliders are only visible when the lighting is on. Remove the dynamic row rules to make the sliders permanently visible.

Changing the position of any slider turns on the lighting.

The colored buttons at the bottom are presets. Tap to turn on the lighting at 5%, double-tap to turn on the lighting at 50%, and hold to turn on the lighting at 100%.

Tap the icon to turn on the lighting with the last setting or to turn it off.

Add a new card to the dashboard and overwrite its entire configuration with the [hue-saturation.yaml](hue-saturation.yaml) file (remember to replace the entities with your own).
