# Slider Lights

A simple example for managing lighting. The first column turns the lighting on/off, with the background color dependent on the device's state and implemented using dynamic rules. The second column is the name, which, when clicked, displays more information. The third column contains a slider for adjusting the brightness.

Add a new card to the dashboard and overwrite its entire configuration with the [slider-lights.yaml](slider-lights.yaml) file (remember to replace the entities with your own).
